# Create New Release GitHub Action

This GitHub Action automates the process of creating a new release when manually triggered. It bumps the version, tags it, and creates a release with autogenerated release notes.

## Workflow Overview

The workflow consists of a single job:

- **Bump version and create release**: Bumps the version, pushes the tag, and creates a GitHub release.

## Workflow Triggers

This action is triggered on:

- Manual workflow dispatch (`workflow_dispatch` event).

## Jobs

### Bump Version and Create Release Job

The `push` job performs the following actions:

- **Get Token**: Uses the `actions/create-github-app-token` action to create a GitHub App token for authentication.
- **Checkout Repo**: Uses the `actions/checkout` action to fetch the repository code.
- **Wait for Workflows to Finish**: Uses the `int128/wait-for-workflows-action` action to wait for any running workflows to complete.
- **Bump Version and Push Tag**: Uses the `anothrNick/github-tag-action` action to bump the version and create a new tag.
- **Create Release**: Uses the `actions/github-script` action to create a release with autogenerated release notes.

## Secrets

This action requires the following secrets:

- `GIT_AUTOMATION_APP_ID`: The GitHub App ID used for authentication.
- `GIT_AUTOMATION_PK`: The private key for the GitHub App used for authentication.
